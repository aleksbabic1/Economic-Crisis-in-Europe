# Economic-Crisis-in-Europe
Author: Aleksandar Babic <br/>
Motivation: What were the implications of the 2008 economic crisis throughout Europe?  Using the European Social Survey to evaluate how countries across Europe dealt with the crisis and how it affected the daily lives of citizens. <br/>
Dataset: The dataset I used was found on European Social Survey, from which I downloaded and imported the data using the package 'essurvey'.  I chose variables that helped me compare the impacts of the economic crisis throughout many European countries. <br/>
